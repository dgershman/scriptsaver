Very simple way to script some stuff as a text file.

1. Download the package
2. Just set the connection string and the output path in the ScriptSaver.exe.config.
3. You will need to create a text file with a list of the procs/functions to backup.  Each one should be on it's own line.
4. Run ScriptSaver.exe and specify the location of the text file with the procs/functions to backup.

ScriptSaver.exe [path-to-text-file]
